#Dependencies
You'll need the following things to get this working:

* git (Duh!)
* node.js
* npm
* redis
* mongo

These are all relatively simple to install on Linux/Mac and slightly annoying on Windows. If you need help, Google is your friend.

#Installation
	git clone https://github.com/Hoverbear/Express-Auth-Seed.git myApp
	cd myApp
	npm install
	node app.js

Next just visit http://localhost:8080 and play around!
